function J = addNoise(I, snr)
% ADDNOISE  Add noise to an image
%
% ## Syntax
% J = addNoise(I, snr)
%
% ## Description
% J = addNoise(I, snr)
%   Returns a version of the input image with added noise.
%
% ## Input Arguments
%
% I -- Input image
%   A greyscale or multi-channel image, in the form of a 2D or 3D array.
%
% snr -- Signal to noise ratio
%   The desired signal to noise ratio of the output image `J`.
%
% ## Output Arguments
%
% J -- Noisy image
%   An image produced by adding noise to `I`. One noise distribution will
%   be computed for each pixel, such that the signal to noise ratio is
%   respected for every pixel. Note that this method almost simulates
%   photon shot noise and pixel response non-uniformity noise that scale
%   with image intensity, except that photon shot noise would scale with
%   the square root of the image intensity [3]. A multi-channel image will
%   receive noise which is correlated between colour channels: Each colour
%   channel value at a given pixel will be perturbed by a noise value drawn
%   from the same point in the cumulative probability density function of
%   its noise.
%
% ## Notes
% - The signal-to-noise ratio is defined as [1]:
%     SNR = 10 * log_10( ||i||_2^2 / ||e||_2^2 )
%   Where, in this implementation, `i` is a single element of `I`, as noise
%   is modeled per-channel, per-pixel. `e` is the noise.
% - Usually, image noise is approximated with Gaussian noise, such as in
%   [1-2]. Photon shot noise follows a Poisson distribution, but other
%   sources of noise are approximately Gaussian [3], so this function uses
%   Gaussian noise. Negative corrupted image values are clipped to zero.
% - This function does not add or account for crosstalk. Crosstalk is
%   likely already present in the input image, unless the image is purely
%   synthetic, so adding more crosstalk between colour channels would
%   produce images which are not realistic. Also, crosstalk is generally
%   spatially-varying (and therefore hard to model). See [4] for a method
%   for modelling crosstalk (which requires professional equipment).
