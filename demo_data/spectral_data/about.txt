Data: Spectral Measurements of Calibration Targets and Light Sources
Bernard Llanos
June 26, 2018

## About
- Data was collected by Jilu Feng (jfeng@ualberta.ca), Research Associate in the
  Faculty of Science - Earth & Atmospheric Sciences Admin.
- Jilu Feng is associated with Dr. Benoit Rivard (benoit.rivard@ualberta.ca),
  a professor in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
- They operate a lab containing hyperspectral imaging equipment
  (CCIS 2-066, http://coresensing.net/), in which the data was collected.

### Equipment used, and general procedure
- An Analytical Spectral Devices point spectrometer with a bare fiber probe was
  used to collect spectral signals.
  - Each spectral data series output be the device is the average of 40 measurements.
  - Specifications for the instrument can be found on the Analytical Spectral
    Devices website, according to Jilu Feng, but I don't think this website still
    exists.
- A Spectralon standard white tile was used as the white reflectance standard.
  It has a reflectance above 98% for wavelengths from 250 nm to 4 micrometres.
- To be clear, the "white standard" is the spectral power distribution of light
  reflected from the white tile, and is therefore illumination-dependent. Sample
  reflectances output by the spectrometer are normalized by the white standard.
- The white standard was set in the spectrometer's software each time the
  illuminant was changed. It is always constant within each set of spectra
  described below, but differs between sets.

## Data Files

### spectra_original.txt
- The data file provided by Jilu Feng. It is a text file created by converting
  the custom-formatted data files, output by the spectrometer, to something more
  like a CSV file.
  - The first column stores wavelength values, whereas the remaining columns
    store the spectral signatures, expressed relative to a white standard.
  - The white standard is not the same for each measurement, as
    described below.

### spectra_named.csv
- A version of 'spectra_original.txt' in CSV format, with columns given more
  meaningful names.

### spectra_averaged.csv
- A version of 'spectra_named.csv' where useless data has been removed,
  and repeated data has been averaged together.
- Specifically, the two spectra for the 550 nm bandpass filter, and for each
  type of square in each chequerboard have been averaged.

### spectra.ods
- A LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet containing the data used to generate the CSV
  files in this folder.
- The second sheet in the file contains the mapping from the original series names
  to meaningful column names.

## Data Sets

### Optical bandpass filters (filter.000 to filter.007)
- Relative spectral power distributions obtained by placing each of the 7 optical
  bandpass filters (VIS (400-700nm) OD 4 10nm Bandpass Filter Kit, 50mm Dia
  filters from Edmund Optics) in front of the Optoma EP739 projector's lens.
  - The filters are in order of center wavelength: 400, 442, 500, 550, 600, 647, 700 nm
- Filters were simply held against the projector lens by hand.
- The spectrum was measured from the bright patch created on a white tile placed
  about 41 cm in front of the projector.
- The white standard is the unfiltered light from the projector illuminating
  the white tile.
- See below for information about the projector.

### Large chequerboard (lc.000 to lc.003)
- 259.5 mm for 12 squares: 2.1625 mm square side length
- Laminated paper
- Page dimensions: 33.8 cm x 32.0 cm
- Two white squares (000 and 001) and two black squares (002 and 003) were
  measured.
- The white standard is the white tile under the same illuminant (a quartz
  halogen lamp).

### Laser printer paper (paper.000 to paper.001)
- Series 000 is a blank piece of paper used in the CSC printer room's
  Xerox WorkCentre 5755 printer.
- Series 001 is a black printout from the printer.
- The white standard is the white tile under the same illuminant (a quartz
  halogen lamp).

### ColorChecker Classic (pat-new.000 to pat-new.023)
- The reflectances of the patches of an 8.25 x 11 inch ColorChecker Classic colour
  calibration chart (https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-classic)
- The patches are in order from left to right, top to bottom.
- The white standard is the white tile under the same illuminant (a quartz
  halogen lamp).

### Small chequerboard (sc.000 to sc.003)
- 202.8 mm for 12 squares: 16.9 mm square side length
- Laminated paper taped to a plastic stand
- Page dimensions: 25.6 cm x 23.3 cm
- Two white squares (000 and 001) and two black squares (002 and 003) were
  measured.
- The white standard is the white tile under the same illuminant (a quartz
  halogen lamp).

### Light from an Optoma EP739 DLP projector (proj.000 to proj.001)
- The projector is to be used for spectral imaging experiments in CSC 2-65.
- I wanted to know if it had a sufficiently broad spectrum.
- We discovered that it was an unstable light source in the infrared range.
  Perhaps this is because of the additional electrical components emitting heat
  besides the projector's lamp.
- More information about the projector is here:
  '/home/llanos/GoogleDrive/ThesisResearch/Equipment/Projector'
  - The projector was configured to project a white test pattern, using its
    service menu.
- Data was obtained from the bright patch created on a white tile placed
  about 41 cm in front of the projector.
- Series 000 was taken about a minute and a half after resetting the white standard
  of the spectrometer.
- Series 001 was taken right after resetting the white standard
  of the spectrometer a second time.
- The two series illustrate that the spectral power distribution changes over time.
  If it was stationary, the two spectra would be equal to unity at all wavelengths.

### First attempts at bandpass filter measurements (proj.000 and proj.001)
- Series 000 was obtained by placing the 400 nm filter in a wooden holder, to
  block stray light, in front of the projector's lens.
- Series 001 was obtained by holding the 442 nm filter in front of the lens
  with a hand.
- We decided to measure the spectra transmitted by all filters by holding the filters
  in place with a hand, and so restarted data collection to obtain the 'filter.###'
  data series.
  - Unfortunately, I did not keep track of whether I was holding each filter such
    that the projector's light was shining against the direction of the arrow on the
    filter's outer ring (which is the proper direction, according to an
    Edmund Optics support representative).
  
## Data analysis
- Code for plotting the data in 'spectra_averaged.csv' and 'spectra_named.csv'
  is in '/home/llanos/GoogleDrive/ThesisResearch/MATLAB/aberration_data/SpectralDataJune262018Averaged.m'
  and '/home/llanos/GoogleDrive/ThesisResearch/MATLAB/aberration_data/SpectralDataJune262018.m', respectively.

## Remarks
- The spectra of the two chequerboard patterns are not the same.
- The chequerboards have a darker black than the LaserJet printer toner.
- There is good agreement between the spectra measured from the colour chart,
  and the data provided by Babel Color (Danny Pascale), saved in
  '/home/llanos/GoogleDrive/ThesisResearch/Data and Results/20180604_ColorCheckerSpectralData_BabelColor/'
  - Most of the spectra of the colour chart have higher reflectances than the
    results from Babel Color.
  - 'purple' and 'blue flower' are the most different from the Babel Color data.
  - Note that the formulations of some chart patches have changed since the data
    from Babel Color was collected (prior to November 2014).
- The bandpass filters seem to have their center wavelengths shifted to smaller
  wavelengths relative to their stated center wavelengths.
- The 442 nm filter unfortunately has a second peak partially overlapping the
  400 nm filter. As this was observed on both attempts at filter measurements,
  it is likely not a measurement error.
  - This feature is not present in the curves provided by Edmund Optics
    ('/home/llanos/GoogleDrive/ThesisResearch/Equipment/Edmund Optics Color Filters/20180627_Optical bandpass filter kit_50 mm diameter_10 nm FWHM_curves.pdf').
  - It may be because the light from the projector is not collimated.
    (Bandpass filters are sensitive to the angle of light, as mentioned at
    https://www.edmundoptics.com/optics/optical-filters/bandpass-filters/)
  - Or it may be that I had oriented the filter in the wrong direction relative
    to the light.
