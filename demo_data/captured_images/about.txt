==============================================================

- The general procedure followed is described in 'ImageCollectionProcedure.pdf'.

Camera Identification
---------------------
- BlackFly Flea3 FL3-GE-50S5C, serial number 14447582
- Computar Lens (8 mm 1:1.4 2/3") labelled "07I"

Fixed Camera Settings
---------------

## Lens Adjustments
- Focus distance: Focused on a large printed dot pattern,
  about 32 cm away from the front of the lens, under unfiltered light from the projector.
- Aperture: 4 (adjusted as a compromise between filtered and unfiltered light)

## Camera Settings tab in FlyCapture2
Brightness: 0.000 %
Exposure: around 1.47 EV (Off)
Sharpness: 1024
Hue: 0.000 deg
Saturation: 100.000 %
Gamma: 1.250 (Off)
Shutter: See below
Gain: 0.000 dB
FrameRate: Off
WB (Red): Off
WB (Blue): Off
Temperature: 47.85 degrees Celsius

## Custom Video Modes tab in FlyCapture2
- Raw 12 pixel format
- Full image size and resolution (2448 x 2048)

## Camera information tab in FlyCapture2
Serial Number: 14447582
Vendor: Point Grey Research
Model: Flea3 FL3-GE-50S5C
Sensor: Sony ICX655AQ (2/3" 2456x2056 CCD)
Resolution: 2448x2048

Default Gateway: 0.0.0.0
IP Assignment:

## Advanced Camera Settings tab in FlyCapture2
- Raw Bayer output is checked, but this presumably only affects Y8 and Y16 modes.
- Y16 Endianness: Little endian

## Look Up Table tab in FlyCapture2
- Disabled

FlyCapture2 Image Capture Settings
---------------
- 15 TIFF images were saved per capture under unfiltered light.
- 5 TIFF images were saved per capture under filtered light.
- In all cases, saving the raw Bayer tile image.
- The frames were consecutive frames.
- TIFF images did not use compression.

Shutter Times
-------------
- Note: All exposures were calibrated on a disk pattern (black disks printed on white paper)

## Filtered light
400 nm: 3916 ms
450 nm: 2000 ms (Red), 250 ms (Green), 50 ms (Blue)
500 nm: 250 ms (Blue), 3915 ms (Red), 100 ms (Green)
550 nm: 25 ms (Green), 500 ms (Red, Blue)
600 nm: 250 ms (Green), 100 ms (Red), 3916 ms (Blue)
650 nm: 3916 ms (Blue), 2000 ms (Green), 100 ms (Red)
700 nm: 3916 ms (Blue, Green), 500 ms (Red)

Summary: 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 2000, 3916 ms

## No filter
3, 6, 12 ms

Data Collected
--------------

February 8, 2019
- Large printed dot pattern, about 32 cm away from the front of the lens
- Repeat with the dot pattern shifted slightly.
- ColorChecker chart placed just in front of the dot pattern.
  - X-Rite Large ColorChecker CLASSIC, August 2016 Edition.

February 18, 2019
- Captured a fresh set of dark frames.
- ColorChecker chart placed just in front of the dot pattern, shifted and angled
  slightly from its position on February 8, 2019.
- A variety of transparent objects 13-30 cm from the lens.
- Ghost ship and dolphin (15-30 cm from lens), with binary noise pattern
  in the background (32 cm from lens).
- Book, CD, glass flask, nested dolls, about 40 cm from the lens.

Data Preprocessing
------------------
- For space constraints, only some of the images are included in this repository.
- The images that are included are only for the filtered illumination conditions,
  for the first capture of the dot pattern scene, and for the second capture
  of the ColorChecker chart scene.
- The images of the dot pattern scene were cropped to reduce space consumption,
  but preserve the image resolution.
- The images of the ColorChecker scene were downsampled to reduce space consumption,
  but preserve the entire field of view.
- Image preprocessing was performed using 'DemoDataPreprocessing.m'.
