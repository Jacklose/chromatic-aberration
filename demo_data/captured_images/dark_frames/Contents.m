% DARK_FRAMES
% Version 1.0.0 18-Jul-2019
%
% Dark frames corresponding to the demo input images. Dark frames are images
% captured under the same exposure settings as other images, but in the absence
% of light. They are subtracted from the other images to correct biases in pixel
% values.
%
% Filenames are of the form:
% 'd*_dark_${exposure time}_${date, time, and number in image capture sequence}.tif'
%
% Dark frames were captured for two separate recording sessions ('d1' and 'd2').
